# Hand-Recognition-Car

TASK 1:
Basically create a code using python, TensorFlow and openCV to dectect what my hand is doing.

Update 1:
- I created the code that turns on my laptops cam and dectects my hand.
- Dectects only 1 hand so far
- Based on my hand motion, it'll make an assumption on what it is:
    1 FWD(forward): open palm hand towards the cam
    2 BWD(backward): cleched fist point upwards, as if u were tryna to do an uppercut

Update 2:
The program works completely fine and is recognizing my hand movements 

TASK 2:
Now that the code is compelete, I want the python code to transfer were the inputs to an arduino/esp32.
